# site Configuration
# ==================
#
# This configuration file will be used for the site.tgz tarball
# and the autoinstall answer file.
#
# It must be parseable by both sh and omir's config reader
# - do not use spaces around '='
# - variable substitution ($VAR) is not supported
# (FIXME: generate sh file on-the-fly)
#
# Rather than changing variables here,
# write your modifications to "config.local".
#
# OFEAT variables control whether a features is enabled (1) or disabled (0).
# OCONF provide the actual data for a particular feature, but will be
# ineffective unless their corresponding OFEAT variable is set to 1.
# A few features are controlled by OCONF variables only.
#
# Unless stated otherwise, feature variables (OFEAT) default to disabled (0).
# Most OCONF variables are optional and default to the empty string (""),
# mandatory ones are flagged accordingly.
#

# Package Management Configuration
# --------------------------------

# URL to local OpenBSD mirror suitable for installurl(5)
#
#   The value provided here relies on a sensible DNS search domain.
OCONF_INSTALLURL_LOCAL='http://omir/OpenBSD/'

# URL to upstream OpenBSD mirror suitable for installurl(5)
OCONF_INSTALLURL_UPSTREAM='https://cdn.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/'

# feature: partial local mirror
#
#   Whether to switch /etc/installurl to the upstream mirror after
#   installing sets, but before installing any system patches or packages.
#
#   This is useful if the local mirror contains the set files only.
#
OFEAT_SHALLOW_LOCAL_MIRROR=1

# Patches and Packages Installation
# ---------------------------------

# feature: Whether to run fw_update -p <local mirror> on first boot
#
#   This is useful if the deployed systems may not access the official
#   firmware servers , or to reduce overall internet
#   bandwidth usage.
#
#   Note that the deployed system will try to fetch firmware files
#   from the official servers (firmware.openbsd.org) during init.
#
#   Depends on OCONF_INSTALLURL_LOCAL.
OFEAT_INSTALL_FW=1

# feature: Whether to run syspatch on first boot
#
#   This will honor the configured installurl.
#
#   Consider enabling OFEAT_AUTO_REBOOT together with this feature.
OFEAT_SYSPATCH=1

# feature: Whether to install packages listed in OCONF_PKG_INSTALL on first boot
OFEAT_PKG_INSTALL=1

# List of packages to be installed
OCONF_PKG_INSTALL="rsync-- vim--no_x11"


# User Accounts
# -------------

# By default, two unprivileged users will be created:
# - a login user that may elevate to root via su(1)
# - an additional user that may not log in and to whom only root can switch
#   via /root/bin/<name> or su -l -s /bin/ksh <name>.
#   This user account may not su(1) to root.
#   It is meant for unprivileged admin purposes.
#
# The users will be named cosmo & wanda unless overridden in config.local.
#
# The login user will also be used for generating the autoinstall answer file,
# so do not set it in config.autoinstall.

# login user (REQUIRED)
#
#  Specify the user name here, the uid will be 1000.
#
#  The passphrase is configured in 'config.autoinstall' (OCONF_INSTALL_LOGIN_USER_PASS).
#  Do not set it here, as it would otherwise be included as-is in the site.tgz file.
#
OCONF_LOGIN_USER='cosmo'

# unprivileged user
#
#   Set the user name and its uid here.
#   The passphrase will be set to "login disabled" (thirteen asterisk chars),
#   it can not be controlled here.
#
#   Can be disabled by setting the user name to the empty string.
#
OCONF_UNPRIV_USER='wanda'
OCONF_UNPRIV_UID='1001'


# Git
# ---

# feature: Whether to install the git package and configure user name/email
# - for the root user
# - for the unprivileged user if OCONF_UNPRIV_USER is also set
#
#   Optional, defaults to disabled (0).
OFEAT_GIT=1

# user name/email for git-config
OCONF_GIT_USER_NAME='autocommit'
OCONF_GIT_USER_EMAIL='admin@localhost'

# feature: Whether to initialize /etc as git repo and check in most files
#
#   Depends on OFEAT_GIT.
OFEAT_GIT_CHECKIN_ETC=0



# Ramdisk
# -------

# The site customization allows to reserve a small amount of system memory
# for use as a disk-like mount to store log files and volatile user data
# that will be wiped on every boot.

# Create and mount the ramdisk at /ram?
OFEAT_RAMDISK=1

# Create per-user directories for root
# and all users with an uid >= 1000 in /ram/users/?
#
#   Only users existing during install.site will be considered,
#   this includes root, the login user (OCONF_LOGIN_USER)
#   and the unprivileged user (OCONF_UNPRIV_USER).
#
#   Depends on OFEAT_RAMDISK.
OFEAT_RAMDISK_USERDIR=1

# Create /ram/log/messages and set up log rotation for it?
#
#   Note that redirections of log messages to that file
#   must be configured separately (and manually) in syslog.conf(5).
#
#   Depends on OFEAT_RAMDISK.
OFEAT_RAMDISK_LOG=1


# SSH Server
# ----------

# Whether to generate /etc/ssh/sshd_config from template
#
#   Basic configuration,
#   only the login user will be allowed to log in (OCONF_LOGIN_USER).
OFEAT_SSHD_CONFIG=1


# Hardware Quirks
# ---------------

# feature: force-sync hardware clock during installation
#
#   EXPERIMENTAL - this is an ugly hack that forces systohw clock sync.
OFEAT_SYNC_HWCLOCK=0


# Finishing Touch
# ---------------

# Whether to remove setup files (/FACTORY/site) when done
OFEAT_AUTO_CLEANUP_FILES=1

# Whether to reboot after running rc.firsttime hooks
#
#   A reboot will only occur if it has been requested by any hook
#   such as syspatch.
OFEAT_AUTO_REBOOT=1


# Network Configuration
# ---------------------

# The default hostname to use if all other means failed (REQUIRED)
OCONF_DEFAULT_HOSTNAME='staging.local'

# Whether to enable overall network configuration
#
#   If disabled, keep the configuration as created by the OpenBSD installer,
#   which will preserve the replies given during install.
OFEAT_NETCONFIG=1

# Network interfaces search list
#
#   Only a single interface will be configured.
#   It defaults to the interface that has a default route
#   (typically the one used for installing OpenBSD),
#   but in some cases that does not suffice, e.g. when installing from cdrom.
#
#   Then, any of the interfaces listed here will be used (on a first-hit basis).
OCONF_NETCONFIG_GUESS_IFACE_LIST='vmx0 vio0'


# There are three main strategies used to determine the network configuration:
#
# (a) current
#     The most basic strategy just uses what is already there.
#     This works for inet[6] address / prefix length / gateway,
#     and is usually not reliable for setting static addresses.
#
# (b) MAC address of the interface plus DNS lookups
#     This is great for configuring static addresses from minimal intel,
#     but requires that the DNS server used during installation
#     is under your control.
#
# (c) DHCPv4
#     Queries hostname / DNS domain search and name servers
#     from the already active DHCP lease of the interface.
#     IPv4 only, hostname should be provided via DHCP.
#
# Several strategies may be selected,
# the first one to succeed configures the interface.
# The "defaults" strategy (current and/or dynamic, see below)
# can not be deselected and is used to fill up missing information.
# It also serves as overall fallback should all other strategies fail.
#
# Order of preference: MAC, DHCPv4, defaults
#

# DNS/MAC-based Network Configuration
# +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

# Enable MAC interface config strategy
OFEAT_NETCONFIG_BY_MAC=1

# DNS zone for mac -> fqdn lookup (CNAME record)
OCONF_NETCONFIG_BY_MAC_LOOKUP_ZONE='boot.local'

# lookup key obfuscation
#
# MAC addresses will always be normalized
# by converting them to lowercase and replacing ':' with '-',
# resulting in a lookup key like '00-00-5e-00-53-01'.
#
# It may then be hashed to hide the actual MAC address.
# Note that does not increase security in the 'source' network
# (the one containing the new machine) since tools like
# tcpdump may reveal the MAC address there.
# As such, it is only meaningful to make tampering zone files
# on the DNS server a little bit more challenging
# or if there is some routing in between.
#
# If necessary, the final result is truncated to 63 chars
# to fit the acceptable length of a domain label.
#
# Known algorithms include:
# - as-is (no obfuscation)
# - sha1
# - sha224
# - sha256 (with truncation)
# - default (-> sha224)
#
OCONF_NETCONFIG_BY_MAC_LOOKUP_KEY='default'

# After retrieving the fully qualified hostname from the lookup zone,
# gateway / name server / time server addresses can be looked up
# relative to the host's domain (A / AAAA records).
#
# For a different approach, see dynamic network configuration below.

#
# EXPERIMENTAL FEATURE -- needs testing

# as detected by OFEAT_NETCONFIG*.
# DNS-related configuration also takes
# the configured hostname into account.
#
# This relies on knowledge about the site's networks
# and is therefore disabled by default.
#
