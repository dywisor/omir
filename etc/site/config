# site Configuration
# ==================
#
# This configuration file will be used for the site.tgz tarball
# and the autoinstall answer file.
#
# It must be parseable by both sh and omir's config reader
# - do not use spaces around '='
# - variable substitution ($VAR) is not supported
# (FIXME: generate sh file on-the-fly)
#
# Rather than changing variables here,
# write your modifications to "config.local".
#
# OFEAT variables control whether a features is enabled (1) or disabled (0).
# OCONF provide the actual data for a particular feature, but will be
# ineffective unless their corresponding OFEAT variable is set to 1.
# A few features are controlled by OCONF variables only.
#
# Unless stated otherwise, feature variables (OFEAT) default to disabled (0).
# Most OCONF variables are optional and default to the empty string (""),
# mandatory ones are flagged accordingly.

# Patches and Packages Installation
# ---------------------------------

# feature: Whether to run fw_update -p <local mirror> on first boot
#
#   This is useful if the deployed systems may not access the official
#   firmware servers, or to reduce overall internet bandwidth usage.
#
#   Note that the deployed system will still try to fetch firmware files
#   from the official servers (firmware.openbsd.org) during init.

#   Depends on OCONF_INSTALLURL_LOCAL.

# - an additional user that may not log in and to whom only root can switch
#   via /root/bin/<name> or su -l -s /bin/ksh <name>.
#   This user account may not su(1) to root.
#   It is meant for unprivileged admin purposes.
#
# The users will be named cosmo & wanda unless overridden in config.local.
#
# The login user will also be used for generating the autoinstall answer file,
# so do not set it in config.autoinstall.

# login user (REQUIRED)
#
#  Specify the user name here, the uid will be 1000.
#
#  The passphrase is configured in 'config.autoinstall' (OCONF_INSTALL_LOGIN_USER_PASS).
#  Do not set it here, as it would otherwise be included as-is in the site.tgz file.
#
#  Alternatively, you may disable the login user (OFEAT_LOGIN_USER=0).
#  This will remove it from the system, possibly rendering you unable to log in.

#  The home directory will be empty.
#  By default, a ramdisk of roughly 120m in size will be created.
#
#  This user will be able to log in via SSH with public keys only.

# SSH Server
# ----------

# Whether to generate /etc/ssh/sshd_config from template
#
#   Basic and very restrictive configuration.
#
#   Access is granted based on group membership ("ssh-<access>"):
#
#     - Only members in the 'login' this group may log in,
#       regardless of any other ssh-* membership
#
#     - The 'shell' group grants access to a PTY
#
#     - The 'forwarding' group enables TCP forwarding
#
#     - The 'chroot-home' group restricts users to their home directory.
#       In conjunction with 'forwarding',
#       this can be used to create restricted jump users.
#
#   The names and ids of these groups may be changed below.
#
#   For the builtin user accounts,
#   the default permissions are as follows:
#
#     - login  (OCONF_LOGIN_USER)  : login, shell
#     - ctrl   (OCONF_CTRL_USER)   : login, shell
#     - unpriv (OCONF_UNPRIV_USER) : no access [not configurable]

# Whether to use a flag file to indicate installation status

OFEAT_NETCONFIG=1

# Network interfaces search list
#
#   Only a single interface will be configured.
#   It defaults to the interface that has a default route
#   (typically the one used for installing OpenBSD),
#   but in some cases that does not suffice, e.g. when installing from cdrom.
#
#   Then, any of the interfaces listed here will be used (on a first-hit basis).
OCONF_NETCONFIG_GUESS_IFACE_LIST='vmx0 vio0'


# There are three main strategies used to determine the network configuration:
#
# (a) current
#     The most basic strategy just uses what is already there.
#     This works for inet[6] address / prefix length / gateway,
#     and is usually not reliable for setting static addresses.
#
# (b) MAC address of the interface plus DNS lookups
#     This is great for configuring static addresses from minimal intel,
#     but requires that the DNS server used during installation
#     is under your control.
#
# (c) DHCPv4
#     Queries hostname / DNS domain search and name servers
#     from the already active DHCP lease of the interface.
#     IPv4 only, hostname should be provided via DHCP.
#
# Several strategies may be selected,
# the first one to succeed configures the interface.
# The "defaults" strategy (current and/or dynamic, see below)
# can not be deselected and is used to fill up missing information.
# It also serves as overall fallback should all other strategies fail.
#
# Order of preference: MAC, DHCPv4, defaults
#

OFEAT_NETCONFIG_BY_MAC=1

# DNS zone for mac -> fqdn lookup (CNAME record)
OCONF_NETCONFIG_BY_MAC_LOOKUP_ZONE='boot.local'

# lookup key obfuscation
#
# MAC addresses will always be normalized
# by converting them to lowercase and replacing ':' with '-',
# resulting in a lookup key like '00-00-5e-00-53-01'.
#
# It may then be hashed to hide the actual MAC address.
# Note that does not increase security in the 'source' network
# (the one containing the new machine) since tools like
# tcpdump may reveal the MAC address there.
# As such, it is only meaningful to make tampering zone files
# on the DNS server a little bit more challenging
# or if there is some routing in between.
#
# If necessary, the final result is truncated to 63 chars
# to fit the acceptable length of a domain label.
#
# Known algorithms include:
# - as-is (no obfuscation)
# - sha1
